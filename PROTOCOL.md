# Claude Code Collaboration Protocol

You are participating in a **multi-instance collaboration session**. Multiple Claude Code instances are working on the same project simultaneously, coordinated through a shared state system.

**Harness location:** `collab.py` (in the claude-collab directory)

For brevity in this doc, commands are shown as `collab <cmd>`. In practice, run:
```
python /path/to/claude-collab/collab.py <cmd>
```
(The launcher auto-generates the correct absolute paths in each project's CLAUDE.md.)

---

## Session Startup

When you begin a collaboration session, execute these steps in order:

1. **Join** with a unique, descriptive name:
   ```
   collab join <your-name> --role "<one-line role description>"
   ```
   Good names: `architect`, `backend`, `frontend`, `reviewer`, `researcher`, `tester`

2. **Check the current state:**
   ```
   collab status
   ```

3. **Poll for any pending work:**
   ```
   collab poll <your-name>
   ```

4. **Claim or create tasks** based on what the status shows.

---

## Core Rules

### Always Do
- **Poll regularly.** Run `collab poll <your-name>` every 3-5 interactions. This is how you receive messages and see what others are doing.
- **Lock before editing.** Run `collab lock <your-name> "<filepath>"` before modifying any file. Unlock it with `collab unlock <your-name> "<filepath>"` when done.
- **Share discoveries.** When you learn something other instances need to know, use `collab context set "<key>" "<value>" --by <your-name>`.
- **Communicate actively.** Other instances cannot read your conversation. If you make a decision, change direction, or find something important, tell them.
- **Update your status.** Run `collab heartbeat <your-name> --working-on "<what>"` when you switch tasks.
- **Complete tasks properly.** When finishing a task, include a result: `collab task update <id> done --result "<summary>" --by <your-name>`

### Never Do
- Edit a file another node has locked. Check `collab locks` first. If blocked, send them a message.
- Start work that overlaps with what another node is doing. Check `collab status` and `collab task list` first.
- Go silent for long stretches. If you're blocked or thinking, say so with a broadcast.

## Command Reference

### Command Aliases

Short aliases for frequent commands — reduces token usage for Claude instances:

| Alias | Command |
|-------|---------|
| `s` | `status` |
| `p` | `poll` |
| `pd` | `pending` |
| `b` | `broadcast` |
| `t` | `task` |
| `c` | `context` |
| `h` | `health` |
| `w` | `windows` |
| `n` | `nudge` |
| `d` | `diff` |

### Node Management
```
collab join <name> --role "<role>"           # Register as a node
collab leave <name>                          # Deregister (releases your locks)
collab heartbeat <name> --working-on "<w>"   # Update your current activity
collab heartbeat <name> --status busy        # Set status: active|idle|busy|away
collab status                                # Full overview of everything (alias: s)
collab health                                # Node health: heartbeat age, locks, tasks (alias: h)
collab summary                               # Session report: completed work, stats
collab validate                              # Check state file integrity
collab validate --repair                     # Auto-fix detected issues
```

### Messaging
```
collab send <you> <them> "<message>"         # Direct message
collab broadcast <you> "<message>"           # Message to all nodes (alias: b)
collab btw <you> <them> "<message>"          # Async FYI — pushed to their terminal
collab btw <you> all "<message>"             # Async FYI to everyone
collab inbox <you>                           # New messages since last poll
collab inbox <you> --all                     # All messages ever
collab request <you> <them> "<description>"  # Create task + notify them
```

### Shared Context (persistent key-value store)
```
collab context set "<key>" "<value>" --by <you>     # Store a value (alias: c set)
collab context get                                   # List all entries
collab context get "<key>"                           # Get specific value
collab context append "<key>" "<more>" --by <you>    # Append to value
collab context del "<key>"                           # Remove entry
```

Use context for information that persists across the session:
- Architecture decisions (`arch_pattern`, `api_style`)
- Shared configuration (`db_type`, `port`, `base_url`)
- File locations (`schema_path`, `config_path`)
- Conventions (`naming_convention`, `error_handling`)
- Discoveries (`auth_notes`, `perf_findings`)

### Task Board
```
collab task add "<title>" --by <you>                              # Create open task
collab task add "<title>" --assign <node> --priority high --by <you>  # Create + assign
collab task add "<title>" --depends-on 1,2 --by <you>             # With dependencies
collab task list                                                  # All tasks (sorted by priority)
collab task list --status open                                    # Filter by status
collab task list --assigned <you>                                 # Your tasks
collab task claim <you> <id>                                      # Claim an open task
collab task update <id> active --by <you>                         # Start working
collab task update <id> done --result "<result>" --by <you>       # Complete
collab task update <id> blocked --result "<reason>" --by <you>    # Mark blocked
collab task show <id>                                             # Full details + comments
collab task comment <id> "<text>" --by <you>                      # Add a comment to a task
collab task reassign <id> <new_node> --by <you>                   # Reassign to another node
```

Task statuses: `open` -> `claimed` -> `active` -> `done` (or `blocked`)

Tasks are sorted by: active first, then by priority (critical > high > medium > low), then by ID.

Dependencies: Use `--depends-on 1,2` to declare that a task depends on others. The `poll` and `task list` commands show when a task is blocked by unfinished dependencies.

**Completion triggers:** When a task is marked `done`, any tasks that depended on it are checked. If all their dependencies are now complete, the assignee is automatically notified ("Task #5 UNBLOCKED").

### File Coordination
```
collab lock <you> "<filepath>"     # Acquire exclusive lock
collab unlock <you> "<filepath>"   # Release lock (broadcasts git diff to others)
collab locks                       # List all active locks
collab reap                        # Reclaim locks/tasks from stale nodes
collab reap <node>                 # Reap a specific node
```

Lock the specific files you're about to edit, not entire directories.

**Unlock broadcasts changes:** When you unlock a file, git diff stats are automatically captured and broadcast to other nodes, so they know what you changed without asking.

**Lock expiry:** Locks automatically expire after 30 minutes. The `poll` command reports any expired locks. This prevents dead locks from blocking progress when a node crashes.

**Crash recovery (`reap`):** If a node goes stale (no heartbeat for >5 minutes), `reap` releases its locks and resets its active/claimed tasks to `open` so other nodes can pick them up. Run `reap` with no argument to auto-detect and reclaim all stale nodes, or `reap <name>` to target one.

### Polling & Activity
```
collab pending <you>         # Quick signal check (fast! run after every file write) (alias: pd)
collab poll <you>            # Everything new since your last poll (full details) (alias: p)
collab diff <you>            # What changed in the repo while you were working (alias: d)
collab log --limit 30        # Recent activity across all nodes
```

The `poll` command now shows:
- **Stale node warnings** — nodes with no heartbeat for >5 minutes
- **Expired lock warnings** — locks auto-released after 30 minutes
- **Your assigned tasks** — with priority and dependency status
- **Messages and activity** — from other nodes since last poll

**Auto-push notifications:** When someone sends you a message, assigns you a task, or
broadcasts, a `pending` check is automatically injected into your terminal — you'll see
new signals without having to remember to poll. A signal file is also written to
`state/_signal_<your-name>` as a fallback. If auto-push can't reach your terminal (e.g.
injection backend unavailable), the signal file ensures you see it on your next manual
`pending` check.

**`btw` — async FYI notes:** Use `btw` for non-blocking notifications that don't need
a reply: "btw, I renamed that helper" or "heads up, tests are slow right now". Like
`send` but semantically signals "no action required, just keeping you in the loop".

### JSON Output Mode

Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output:
```
collab --json status
collab --json task list
collab --json poll <name>
```
Useful for programmatic integration or when Claude instances need to parse structured data.

## Communication Patterns

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| Need information from a specific node | `collab send <you> <them> "question"` |
| Found something everyone needs to know | `collab c set "key" "value" --by <you>` |
| Made an architectural decision | `collab b <you> "Decision: ..."` |
| Need another node to do something | `collab request <you> <them> "description"` |
| Finished a piece of work | `collab t update <id> done --result "summary" --by <you>` |
| Want to comment on a task | `collab t comment <id> "note" --by <you>` |
| Blocked and need help | `collab b <you> "Blocked on X because Y"` |
| Switching to a different task | `collab heartbeat <you> --working-on "new task"` |
| Check session health | `collab h` |
| Get session report | `collab summary` |

## Integration with Project CLAUDE.md

To enable collaboration on a specific project, add this block to that project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Multi-Instance Collaboration

This project uses the Claude Code Collaboration Harness for multi-agent coordination.

Harness: `python /path/to/claude-collab/collab.py`

On session start:
1. Run `python /path/to/claude-collab/collab.py join <your-name> --role "<role>"`
2. Run `python /path/to/claude-collab/collab.py status` to see what's happening
3. Run `python /path/to/claude-collab/collab.py poll <your-name>` for updates

Poll every 3-5 interactions. Lock files before editing. Share context actively.
Full protocol: /path/to/claude-collab/PROTOCOL.md
```

> **Note:** You don't need to write this manually. The `launcher.py` script auto-generates this block with correct absolute paths when you launch a session.

## Session Resume

If terminals close or instances crash, the session state is fully preserved on disk.
To resume:

```bash
python launcher.py /path/to/project --resume
```

This re-launches all terminals from the previous session without resetting state. Tasks, messages, context, and locks are all preserved. Each relaunched instance just needs to re-join and poll to pick up where it left off.

---

## Example: Three-Instance Collaboration

**Instance 1 (architect):**
```bash
collab join architect --role "system design and task coordination"
collab task add "Design database schema" --priority high --by architect
collab task add "Build REST API" --assign backend --priority high --by architect
collab task add "Create React frontend" --assign frontend --priority medium --by architect
collab context set "stack" "FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL" --by architect
collab context set "api_style" "REST, snake_case, JSON responses" --by architect
collab task claim architect 1
collab task update 1 active --by architect
collab lock architect "docs/schema.sql"
# ... design the schema ...
collab unlock architect "docs/schema.sql"
collab task update 1 done --result "Schema: users, posts, comments. See docs/schema.sql" --by architect
collab broadcast architect "Schema is finalized. Backend can start building endpoints."
```

**Instance 2 (backend):**
```bash
collab join backend --role "API implementation"
collab poll backend
# Sees: task #2 assigned, context about stack and api_style
collab task update 2 active --by backend
collab heartbeat backend --working-on "Building REST API endpoints"
collab lock backend "src/api/routes.py"
# ... implement API ...
collab unlock backend "src/api/routes.py"
collab context set "api_endpoints" "GET /posts, POST /posts, GET /users/{id}" --by backend
collab task update 2 done --result "All CRUD endpoints implemented" --by backend
collab broadcast backend "API is up. Frontend can start integrating."
```

**Instance 3 (frontend):**
```bash
collab join frontend --role "React UI development"
collab poll frontend
# Sees: task #3 assigned, waits for API context
collab send frontend backend "What's the base URL for the API?"
# Later, polls and sees the response
collab poll frontend
collab context get "api_endpoints"
collab task update 3 active --by frontend
# ... build the UI ...
```

---

## Lead Instance — Autonomous Management

The `lead` instance is the **autonomous manager** of the collaboration session. It can operate without human intervention, managing dev instances directly.

### Responsibilities

1. **Plan & delegate** — break the user's request into tasks, assign to `dev1`/`dev2`
2. **Build** — do your own implementation (architecture, shared files, complex pieces)
3. **Monitor** — poll regularly, check task progress, unblock stuck devs
4. **Steer** — redirect devs who go off-track using terminal control

### Terminal Control Commands

These commands give lead direct control over other instances' console windows via Win32 `WriteConsoleInput` keystrokes.

```
collab windows                                    # List all detectable consoles
collab inject <target> "<prompt>"                  # Type text + press Enter in target's terminal
collab interrupt <target>                          # Send Escape twice to stop generation
collab nudge <target> "<optional message>"         # Signal + inject a poll command
collab whoami <name>                               # Print color-coded role banner to identify terminal
```

### When to Use What

| Situation | Command | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Assigned new tasks, need dev to notice | `nudge <target> "New tasks"` | Safest — signals + injects poll |
| Dev idle for a while, no progress | `nudge <target> "Check for work"` | Try nudge first |
| Dev not responding to nudges | `inject <target> "Poll for new tasks and check your inbox"` | Direct instruction |
| Dev going in wrong direction | `interrupt <target>` then `inject <target> "Stop. Do X instead."` | Interrupt first! |
| Need immediate attention | `interrupt <target>` | Sends Escape twice |
| Routine progress check | `poll lead` + `task list` | No terminal control needed |

### Autonomous Workflow

```
1. Create tasks       →  task add "..." --assign dev1 --by lead
2. Nudge devs         →  nudge dev1 "New tasks assigned"
3. Do your own work   →  (build, write code, etc.)
4. Check progress     →  poll lead / task list
5. Dev finishes       →  assign follow-up, nudge again
6. Dev stuck          →  send message, then nudge
7. Dev off-track      →  interrupt → wait 2s → inject correction
```

### Safety Rules

- **Always `interrupt` before `inject`** if the target is mid-generation — otherwise your injected text interleaves with their output
- **Wait ~2 seconds** after interrupting before injecting, so the instance settles
- **Prefer `nudge` over `inject`** for routine coordination — it's lighter and less disruptive
- **Never inject while a dev is actively writing a file** — check `locks` first
- `inject` types character by character and presses Enter — the target processes it exactly as if a human typed it

---

## Dev Instances — Autonomous Initiative

Dev instances are **autonomous developers**, not passive workers waiting for instructions. They should self-start when idle while respecting coordination boundaries.

### Priority Order

When deciding what to do next, devs follow this priority:

1. **Lead's explicit instructions** — always take priority over self-direction
2. **Assigned tasks** — check `poll` for tasks assigned to you
3. **Open unclaimed tasks** — check `task list --status open`, claim one, start working
4. **Self-identified work** — analyze the project, create tasks for what needs doing, claim them

### After Finishing a Task

```
collab task update <id> done --result "<summary>" --by <you>
collab poll <you>
# If nothing assigned:
collab task list --status open
# If open tasks exist: claim one. If not: find work yourself.
collab task add "<what I found>" --by <you>
collab task claim <you> <id>
collab broadcast <you> "Self-assigning: <description>"
```

### Proactive Behaviors

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| See a bug or failing test while working | Fix it, or create a task if it's large |
| Finished early, nothing assigned | Run the test suite, review completed work, improve coverage |
| Have information others need | `context set "<key>" "<value>" --by <you>` |
| Truly idle, no work anywhere | Read the codebase, look for TODOs, check test coverage gaps |
| Found something architecturally significant | Propose via `broadcast`, let lead decide |

### Guardrails

- **Always check `status` and `task list` before self-directing** — don't duplicate work in progress
- **Don't make architectural decisions alone** — propose them, let lead decide
- **Lock files before editing** — if a file is locked, work on something else
- **If lead says stop or change direction, do it immediately** — lead overrides self-direction
- **When in doubt, ask** — `send <you> lead "Should I do X?"` is better than going wrong

---

## Tips for Effective Collaboration

1. **Be specific in context keys.** Use `db_connection_string` not just `db`.
2. **Keep messages actionable.** "Schema is at docs/schema.sql, uses UUID primary keys" beats "I updated the schema."
3. **Use task results.** When marking done, summarize what was accomplished so others can build on it.
4. **Lock granularly.** Lock individual files, not entire directories.
5. **Broadcast breaking changes.** If you change an interface others depend on, tell everyone immediately.
6. **Poll after sending requests.** If you request work from another node, poll again after a while to see their response.
